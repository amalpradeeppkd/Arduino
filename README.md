# Arduino
Arduino Program that accept the password 3 times.
I had used 2 Led for this
if the password is wrong it will 'ON" the  1st led and 2 nd will be "OFF"  and
if the password is Correct it will 'OFF" the  1st led and 2 nd will be "ON"
and all the 3 times password is wrong it will blink the 2 LED 

you can use any noise sensor and raise an alarm  if password is wrong all the 3 attempts
